# What a release gets once its files are on it: a "Which file do I download?" table under its notes, and SHA256SUMS,
# the SHA-256 of every other file on it in sha256sum's format (sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS checks a
# download). The sums are GitHub's own digests of the uploaded files; a file without one is downloaded and hashed.
# The Release workflow's publish job runs this for a release before publishing it, and scripts/release_upload.sh for
# a tag pushed by hand (and the nightly). Needs gh, with GH_TOKEN (contents: write) and GH_REPO set.
#
#   scripts/release_files.sh table <tag>             the table, in Markdown
#   scripts/release_files.sh finish <tag> [<out>]    the table under the notes (once), and SHA256SUMS uploaded (also
#                                                    written to <out>). Two runs at once (the Linux and Windows release
#                                                    jobs of a tag) leave the sums of every file: each one checks the
#                                                    uploaded SHA256SUMS against the files after uploading it.
#   scripts/release_files.sh check <tag> <name> ...  each named file and SHA256SUMS are on the release, and SHA256SUMS
#                                                    lists every other file on it, with its digest

### Which file do I download?

| On | Download |
|---|---|
| Windows | \`SheikahBuilder.exe\`, the setup |
| Linux, Steam Deck | $appimage |

You need your own copy of the game. \`sheikah-setup.txt\`, \`sheikah-linux.txt\` and the \`.zsync\` are for the updaters. To check a download: \`sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS\`, or \`gh attestation verify <file> -R $GH_REPO\`.
