"""The pipeline state lists (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp: sheikah_pipeline_states.bin, written as the game is played): show them, keep the
repository's sources of the list a release ships, and merge those into it.

The repository keeps the list a release ships as separate sources in assets/pipeline_states/ (README.md there):

    tour.bin.xz                 written only by the pipeline tour (scripts/pipeline_tour.py), replaced whole each time
    contrib/<name>.bin.xz       one per contributed list, added to and never edited by anyone else
    <source>.md                 beside each: where it comes from (who, GPU and driver, build, settings, route)

nx2/make_game.py merges them (the tour's first, then the contributed ones by name; each pipeline once) into the game folder's
sheikah_pipeline_states_shipped.bin, whose pipelines the first start's shader preparation builds before the title. The same
sources always merge into the same bytes.

    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py <list>...                            what they hold
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py add <name> <list>... --who ... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...
        a contributed list, contrib/<name>.bin.xz: the lists' pipelines that no other contributed list holds (to an existing
        <name>, its pipelines are kept and the new ones added), and its note contrib/<name>.md
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py tour <list>... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...
        tour.bin.xz and tour.md replaced by the lists' pipelines (the pipeline tour runs it)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py merge --out <file>                    the merged list (xz when <file> ends in .xz)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py check                                 each source whole, of this build's format, not empty,
                                                                          with its note; the merge the same twice (CI runs it)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py --out <file> <list>...               lists merged, each pipeline once (any lists)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py --check <list>...                    each list whole and holding pipelines

add, tour, merge and check take --dir <sources folder> (default: the repository's assets/pipeline_states).

A list may be xz-compressed (read by its magic; written so when its name ends in .xz, with fixed settings, so the same records
always give the same bytes): the repository's are, so that its history stays small. xz, not zstd: the AppImage's Python (3.12)
has lzma but not compression.zstd.

A list holds no game code: each record is a pipeline's stage code keys (hashes of the game's shaders, which the player's own
sheikah_shaders.bin turns back into the shaders), the program variant's hash, and the formats and draw state baked into the pipeline.

    <list>: "HKSTATE1", u32 record size (528), then the records:
            u64 code[4] (vertex or mesh, fragment, task, the header-only stage), u64 variant,
            u32 mesh, topology, targets, samples, depth format, has depth, u32 color formats[8], u8 color types[8],
            u64 blend[8], u32 vertex attributes[16], u32 attribute count, u32 strides[16], u32 divisors[16],
            u32 blend enables, channel mask, polygon mode, depth clamp, alpha to coverage, pad,
            u32 answers, u32 questions, u32 answers[24] (stage, descriptor, image, type), u8 questions[32] (each answer as asked)

When the record's format changes, every source is converted (or the tour's made again): the layout of the folder stays.
